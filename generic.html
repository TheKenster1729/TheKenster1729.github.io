								<p>This is a question that I do not get asked nearly as often as I would prefer - not because I want attention
									(although it would be nice once in a while), but because it's actually quite a nice story. My retelling of 
									the story is based on the description given by Hofstader in the book "GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal 
									Golden Braid".
								</p>
								<p>Ramanujan was a mathematician from India active during the early 20th century. Despite receiving no formal 
									mathematics education, he was able to write theorems of stunning brilliance seemingly out of nowhere. 
									Through a serendipitous series of events, he was invited to study in England under the guidance of G. H.
									Hardy, a prominent contemporary. Unfortunately, Ramnujan's health was not commensurate with his brilliance,
									and he tragically died at a young age. Some time before his death, when he was in the hospital, Hardy came
									to visit Ramanujan. Hardy remarked that he had take a taxicab with the number 1729, further stating 
									that he was not impressed with that number, and hoped it was not a bad omen. Ramanujan imemdiately replied,
									"No, it is an interesting number." Why? Because it is the first positive integer that can be written as the
									sum of the cubes of two different positive integers in two different ways. Specifically, 1729 = 1<sup>3</sup>
									+ 12<sup>3</sup> and 1729 = 10<sup>3</sup> + 9<sup>3</sup>.
