								<p>Here is the full course material for this 6-session class that I taught in the summer of 2021 to primarily middle school students.
									The goal of the course was to survey the basic principles of epidemiology (at least the ones I was most familiar with at the time) 
									but also add a bit of a popular science element to it, because the course was addressed to younger students. My central aim when 
									teaching to this demographic is not necessarily to present topics in the rigorous, technical way they usually are, but to inspire - 
									to show that the field is more than just memorization of facts, and to encourage each student to further investigate the topics that
									they find interesting. <br></br>

									Do note, if you choose to use some or all of the material here, that I didn't typically check whether the images I used were 
									copyrighted. All the material was intended, and strictly used for, educational purposes. Thus, you might be in a somewhat of a pickle
									if you want to use these for commercial purposes. Would not reccomend.
