							<section id="content" class="main">
								<p>Here is the class content for The Science of Happiness, a course I taught to a group of middle and high school students in the summer of 2021. 
									The original inspiration for teaching this class was a column in <em>The Atlantic</em> magazine by Arthur Brooks called "How To Build a Life".
									I have no real education in this area, so I did a (relatively small) literature review to prepare the class materials. My motivation to teaching it to
									young students was to get them to think scientifically (read: critically) not just about their own lives, but about the scientific material that 
									they will most likely encounter in the future. As such, I put a major emphasis in the course on understanding what makes good science, and how we 
									should critically evaluate studies and claims that appear in the media or even in scientific reports. Of course, I concurrently attempted to explain
									what the modern study of happiness has revealed about this most curious human enterprise. <br></br>

									Do note, if you choose to use some or all of the material here, that I didn't typically check whether the images I used were 
									copyrighted. All the material was intended, and strictly used for, educational purposes. Thus, you might be in a somewhat of a pickle
									if you want to use these for commercial purposes. Would not reccomend.
