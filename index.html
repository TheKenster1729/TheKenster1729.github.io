											<h2>Bio and Background</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Hello internet, my name is Kenny, and I'm from West Haven, CT (currently living in Cambridge, MA). After spending quite some time not 
											knowing for sure what I wanted to major in, I settled on biology (expected graduation date 2023). I have not 
											resolved the question of what I am going to be doing post-graduation, though I have many career paths I am considering. An easily
											excited individual, I enjoy learning about new things and thinking about the world. On a less abstract level, I am fond of 
											nature, talking with people, music (listening to it, and playing it via the guitar, piano, and ukulele), books, cooking, and an
											assortment of other items and activities. Make sure to check out <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenneth-cox-94a779156/"> my LinkedIn profile </a>
											and <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">drop a like and subscribe</a>.

										<h3>Undergraduate Association Committee on COVID-19, Fall 2020 - Spring 2021</h3>
										<p>Worked with students, student leaders, and administrators to identify and solve student body problems that arose in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. First, I led a team that focused on understanding MIT public health policy to enhance student decision-making capabilities, and then I co-led a team that advocated for expansion of the number and variety of on-campus spaces that were available for students to work in.</p>

										<h3>Quantifying Key Input Uncertainties in the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM), Present </h3>
										<p>Using the EPPA climate model, I study which input factors have the largest impact on the climatologically important output factors (e.g. carbon emissions). A first round of results is has been published under <a href = https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021EF002239>"Representing Socio-Economic Uncertainty in Human System Models"</a>.</p>

										<h3>Dynamics of Homologous Recombination in <em>S. Pombe</em>, June 2017 - August 2018</h3>
										<p>Worked in the lab of Megan King in the Boyer Center for Molecular Medicine (Yale School of Medicine) under graduate student (now Dr.) Amanda Vines and studied the mechanism of homologous recombination (a DNA repair technique) in yeast. The work in the lab led to <a href = https://www.molbiolcell.org/doi/10.1091/mbc.E20-07-0433>a paper on our results</a>. Image credit: MicrobeWiki</p>
