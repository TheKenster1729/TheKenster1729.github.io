								<p>I decided to teach a class about the end of the world after reading Toby Ord's book <it>The Precipice</it>. I realized that a scientific examination
                                    of the apocalypse was possible and I set out to spread its fruits to the young people of the Boston Metropolitan Statistical Area. The class
                                    focused on Nick Bostrom's ontology of existential risk and the four main categories of it that people seemed to be worried about these days: nuclear war,
                                    climate change, runaway AI, and bioengineered pandemics. The slides for this 6-session class are located below.

                                    </br>
									Do note, if you choose to use some or all of the material here, that I didn't typically check whether the images I used were 
									copyrighted. All the material was intended, and strictly used for, educational purposes. Thus, you might be in a somewhat of a pickle
									if you want to use these for commercial purposes. Would not reccomend.
