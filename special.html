								<p>I'm very interested in audio production (but not very good at it), so I've done a bit of work in that area in my free time. At left, I present Exhibit A, my podcast about an experience I had teaching a class to high school students, which eventually just became me essentially ranting about the inadequacy of science education in America. After listening to it, you will probably not be surprised to learn that it did not win the competition it was created for, the NPR Student Podcast Challenge. But hey, it's not the destination, it's the friends you make along the way, and while I didn't make any friends through this podcast, I certainly had a lot of fun doing it. And, if you (yes, reader - YOU) are interested in podcasting, I would highly recommend giving it a shot.</p>

									<h2>Teaching</h2>
								</header>
								<p>As indicated above, I have taught a class to high school students in the past. In fact, I have taught many classes to high school students through a program at MIT called ESP, which runs familiar educational outreach programs at MIT like Splash along with other offerings. I have taught classes that have met only once, that have met three times, and even classes that have met 6 or 7 times. Below, you can find the Powerpoints to two of my classes, both taught in the summer of 2021 (although both were also offered in an altered version in the past). </p>
